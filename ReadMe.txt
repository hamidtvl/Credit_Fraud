this project aims to use Credit Fraud dataset on kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud].
for classification.
the data itself is heavily imbalanced and thats the challenge we face.
i first removed the outliers and use both under sampling and over sampling techniques to find a better classifier model with good performance
